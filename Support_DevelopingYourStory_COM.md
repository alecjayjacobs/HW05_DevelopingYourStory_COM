Supporting Considerations

Visualizations: In this OP-ED, I paid close attention to the Gestalt principles and various pre-attentive techniques (color, form, positioning) when visualizing the data to support my narrative. I reduced “chartjunk” - cleaning up unnecessary background elements, grid accents, and labels. I was intentional about the title and subtitle, including useful language and left justifying for readability along with adding the data source. Close attention was paid to color consistency, which I employed consistently throughout to create visual connection. All visualizations were designed with a minimalist, journalistic quality, hoping to contribute to an ease of story comprehension.

Clarity And Organization: This OP-ED was formatted in R Markdown - making it easy to follow and scroll through. I organized my OP-ED as an appeal to the Mayor of Park City, Utah. In terms of organization, I began with a "hook" and moved through with the environmental & situational context; ultimately, ending with a call to action. Overall, I looked to depict a problem (affordable workforce housing in Park City) built around supportive figures while also producing a compelling story. I wanted to frame the narrative around a effected group (J-1 seasonal workers), and urge an "tactical" action contributing to widespread change.
